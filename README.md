## 1. The Problem

Multiparameter patient monitors (MPMs) output a huge stream of data (ECG, SpO2, NIBP, etc.), but this data is often just displayed, not interpreted. A simple "expert system" could provide a quick, preliminary analysis to help medical staff identify potential conditions or emergencies.

## 2. Our Solution

For our "Introduction to Medical Informatics" project, our team (Kelompok 3) developed a Python application that acts as a simple **Multiparameter Analyzer**.

The program (`Code Python_Kelompok 3_Project PIM.py`) functions as a rule-based expert system:
1.  It prompts the user to input 7 vital sign parameters (ECG, Respiration, SpO2, NIBP, etc.).
2.  It uses a complex series of `if/elif/else` statements to check these values against normal physiological ranges.
3.  Based on the combination of high or low values, it provides a list of possible patient conditions (e.g., "Shock, Gagal Jantung, Hipotermia...").

## 3. My Role & Key Contributions

I was a **Co-developer and Author** on this team project.

* Helped research the normal physiological ranges for the 7 parameters.
* Wrote and debugged the `if/elif` logic in the Python script (`Program Python_Kelompok 3_Project PIM.py`).
* Ensured the program correctly handled user input (as `float`).
* Co-authored the final 39-page paper explaining the program's logic and its application in medical informatics.
